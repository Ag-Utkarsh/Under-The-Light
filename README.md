🕵️‍♂️ UNDER THE LIGHT — Unity 2D Game
Description:

In this narrative-driven 2D Unity game, the player assumes the role of a suspect found near a crime scene.
Facing a tense interrogation, the player must type their own free-text responses to questioning by the officer within a 60-second time limit.
The game's system analyzes user input in real-time using a keyword-based knowledge response model, adjusting trust scores based on the credibility of answers.

🎯 Dynamic Response System — Player-written text is interpreted dynamically, allowing unique dialogue paths.

⏳ One-Minute Pressure — A real-time ticking clock increases tension as the player races to defend themselves.

📚 Knowledge-Based AI Logic — Player inputs are matched to an internal keyword-response system that simulates intelligent reactions.

🎶 Immersive Atmosphere — Background interrogation music and blinking time warnings enhance the suspense.
